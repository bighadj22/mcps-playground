## üöÄ Get Started in Minutes!

1.  **Visit the Playground:** Go to [**mcpsplayground.com**](https://mcpsplayground.com).
2.  **Configure Claude:**
    *   Navigate to the "AI Model" (or "API") tab.
    *   Enter your Anthropic API Key (starts with `sk-ant-...`).
    *   Optionally, set a custom system prompt.
3.  **Add MCP Servers:**
    *   Go to the "MCP Servers" tab.
    *   Use "Quick Add" for example servers or "Add MCP Server Manually" for your own.
    *   Provide a name, the server's **SSE URL**, and a bearer token if required.
4.  **Chat & Use Tools:**
    *   Head back to the "Chat" panel. Claude can now use tools from your connected servers!
    *   Explore the "Available Tools" panel to see what's discovered and even execute them manually.

## üí° What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification that allows Language Models (like Claude) to securely and reliably interact with external tools, services, and data sources. It standardizes how an LLM agent discovers capabilities, calls tools, and receives results. MCP Playground primarily focuses on demonstrating these interactions with servers using the **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** transport for real-time updates.
