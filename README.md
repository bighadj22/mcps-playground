## üöÄ Get Started in Minutes!

1.  **Visit the Playground:** Go to [**mcpsplayground.com**](https://mcpsplayground.com).
2.  **Configure Your AI Provider:**
    *   Navigate to the "AI Model" (or "API") tab.
    *   **For Claude:** Enter your Anthropic API Key (starts with `sk-ant-...`).
    *   **For Gemini:** Enter your Google AI Studio API Key (starts with `AIza...`).
    *   **Provider Selection:** Choose your preferred AI provider (Claude or Gemini).
    *   **Model Selection:** Pick from available models (e.g., claude-3-5-sonnet, gemini-2.0-flash).
    *   Optionally, set a custom system prompt.
3.  **Add MCP Servers:**
    *   Go to the "MCP Servers" tab.
    *   Use "Quick Add" for example servers or "Add MCP Server Manually" for your own.
    *   Provide a name, the server's **SSE URL**, and a bearer token if required.

## üí° What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a specification that allows Language Models (like Claude and Gemini) to securely and reliably interact with external tools, services, and data sources. It standardizes how an LLM agent discovers capabilities, calls tools, and receives results. MCP Playground primarily focuses on demonstrating these interactions with servers using the **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** transport for real-time updates, supporting both Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini models.
