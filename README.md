## üí° What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized specification that enables Language Models like Claude and Gemini to securely interact with external tools, services, and data sources. MCP defines how AI agents:

*   üîç **Discover capabilities** from connected servers
*   üõ†Ô∏è **Execute tools** with proper parameter validation  
*   üì¶ **Receive structured results** for further processing
*   üîê **Maintain security** through controlled access patterns

MCP Playground demonstrates these interactions using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** transport for real-time communication, supporting both Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini with advanced tool management features.
